## Description
Instead of the typical Sudoku with 9 different 3x3 grids this repo creates a single individual grid. We currently support three difficulties: Easy (3x3), Medium (4x4), and Hard (5x5). Each grid has various layouts picked at random when the page is loaded to provide replayability amongst the difficulties.
